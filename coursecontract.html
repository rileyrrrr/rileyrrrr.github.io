			<p> I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
					 I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences. </p>
