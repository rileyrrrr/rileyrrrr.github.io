		<li><strong>Personal Backgroud:  </strong> I have just turned 21 years old and have lived in North Charlotte for 11 years now. 
		I have a lot of different hobbies and things that I want to pursure it can become overwhelming. I have an eccomerce side business and have been reading into stocks and cryptocurrency learning about the technology they use. </li>
		
		<li><strong>Academic Background: </strong> I graduated from high school in 2019 and have been pursuing and taking classes at CPCC since 2018. It was just last semester I decided what degree I want to pursue and would 
		be the most beneficial towards my career and that is the Full Stack Programming.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Background in this Subject: </strong> I have had a little experience with building websites back in high school but never took it too seriously until I started taking classes at CPCC. This will be my third class about
		web technology and second class focused on just web development as I previously took Web 110. </li>
		
		<li><strong>Courses that I am taking </strong></li>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting: </strong> To learn more about HTML CSS, and get an understadning of Java Script. </li>
			<li><strong>CIS115 - Intro to Programming and Logic: </strong> Its needed for my degree and get an idea of python, C++, and Java. </li>
			<li><strong>CSC154 - Software Development:</strong> Required for my degree not much else to say.</li>
			<li><strong>DBA 110 - Database Concepts:</strong> I don't think this is needed for my degree but I've never done anything with databases so I didn't want to just jump into DBA120 without at least knowing the basics.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Funny or interesting thing about yourself:</strong> I own 2 Siamese cats and they are very clingy and sit on my lap when I do work and stand on my keyboard sometimes when I'm away. </li>
